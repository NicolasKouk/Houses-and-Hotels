# Houses-and-Hotels

Houses & Hotels is a multi-player economics-themed board game. 
In the game, players roll two dice to move around the game board, 
buying and selling properties and developing them with houses and 
hotels. Players collect rent from their opponents, aiming to 
drive them into bankruptcy.
